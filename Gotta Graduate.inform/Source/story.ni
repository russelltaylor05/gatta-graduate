Understand "turn off [device]" as switching off.
Understand "put [something] in [container]" as inserting it into.
Understand "open [openable closed thing]" as opening.
Understand "close [openable open thing]" as closing.

		make no decision.
Does the player mean inserting a battery compartment into: it is very unlikely.
Does the player mean inserting something into a device: it is unlikely.

Instead of examining Foaad:
	say "[The noun] looks like he could use a solder pen. Better go find that"
	
Instead of talking to Foaad:
	say "I could really use a solder pen for my side project, I'm sure I can give you something for it".
	
before giving something to foaad:
	if noun is a solder pen:
		if noun is empty:
			say "This is useless with out a battery";
			stop the action;
		if noun is not empty:
			say "Ah this will help me alot. What did you say you were doing? anyways I have this 'A' I can give you, but how about this key? [paragraph break] ::you now carry the key foaad gave you::";
			now the player has the North Atrium Key;
	otherwise:
		say "I only want the solder pen";

[-------Enemy Battle--------]

[Player is in South Hall 5.]

Enemy is a kind of thing. An enemy can be dead. An enemy is usually not dead. An enemy has a number called enemy-health. The plural of enemy is enemies.

[Unix1 is a kind of enemy. Enemy-health of Unix1 is 5.
There is 1 Unix1 in 14-254. It is scenery.]

Unix1 is an enemy. Enemy-health of Unix1 is 5.
Unix1 Battle is a scene.

[Started substituting Room 252 for 14-254 for the time being]
Unix1 Battle begins when (the player is in Room 252 for the first time) or (the player is in Room 252 and the enemy is not dead).

[Unix1 Battle begins when the player is in 14-254 and the enemy is not dead.]

When Unix1 Battle begins:
	Move Unix1 to Room 252; 
	say "The door behind you closes and locks itself. It's a trap! [Paragraph break]";
	Now Door 252 is closed; [Close all the doors in room.]
	Now Door 252 is locked; [Lock all the doors in room.]
	say "Unix1 is on the computer. It looks pissed.".

When Unix1 Battle ends:
	Remove Unix1 from play; [Unlock all doors in room.]
	say "The screen fades to the usual terminal. [Paragraph break]";
	now Door 252 is unlocked;
	say "The door to the north makes a clicking noise. It seems to be unlocked.".

Unix1 Battle ends when (Unix1 is dead). [The enemy will always be present till it dies.]

[Every turn:
	Let playerLocation be the location of the player;
	if an enemy is in playerLocation and an enemy is not dead:
		say "I am here.";
	otherwise:
		say "What enemy.".]

Every turn during Unix1 Battle:
	Let playerLocation be the location of the player; [Create a condition that the player is in combat, possibly turn wifi on or off. Give a chance for the player to leave and charge phone and kick them out of battle till they recharge. Also regain enemy health when they are not battling.]
	Repeat with currentEnemy running through enemies in playerLocation:
		Let enemy-attack be a random number between 1 and 2;
		if enemy-attack is 1:
			say "[currentEnemy] uses open browser twice.[Paragraph break]";
			say "You lose a set amout of Battery life. (1)[Paragraph break]"; [Change this to say and decrease actual battery life.]
		else if enemy-attack is 2:
			say "[currentEnemy] uses Cntr^D on you.[Paragraph break]";
			say "You lose a set amount of Battery life. (2?)[Paragraph break]"; [Change this to say and decrease actual battery life.]
		[say "[currentEnemy]: Attack! [enemy-health of currentEnemy] [Paragraph break]";
		Decrease the Enemy-Health of Unix1 by 1;]
	If the Enemy-health of Unix1 is 0:
		Now Unix1 is dead.
