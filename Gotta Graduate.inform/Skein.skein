You are in the Software Design Lab at 9pm working on the last programming assignment of your last day of your last quarter at Cal Poly. In order to graduate you NEED to finish this program, or else you will get kicked out of college.

Gotta Graduate
An Interactive Fiction by Robin Verweij, David O&apos;Connor, Ryan Chan, Luke Plewa, Lauren Thurston, and Russell Taylor
Release 1 / Serial number 130423 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Software Design Lab
A lab room lined with computers with a projector and table at the center. North is a doorway leading to the hall.

You are finishing up your program, checking to make sure everything compiles and that your name is on the source code. You go to SSH into Vogon, when you realize that something is wrong. You cannot access Vogon, so you shrug it off and try Unix1. After you realize that Unix1 is not working, you start to lightly perspire. You desperately want to go home to your bed and fluffy pillow and sleep. As you try Unix2 and fail to connect once again, you bang your head on the table. What to do?


You can see Software Design Lab Door, a charger and Dr Gene Fisher here.

I see you have a smart phone. I have prepared a phone application to attack the servers should anything go wrong. You can download the app, DDOS, onto your phone from the app store. I have heard of other professor who have created phone apps of their own in case of this emergency. Perhaps they are in the building and can help as well.
